# Bare Repository
A bare repository in Git is a repository that doesn't have a working directory. In other words, it contains only the version control information and the Git database, without the actual files in the project.

When you create a regular Git repository (a non-bare repository) using `git init` or `git clone`, Git sets up a working directory where you can modify files, stage changes, commit them, etc. This is the typical setup for a local development environment.

On the other hand, a bare repository is often used as a central repository that multiple developers can push changes to and pull changes from. It doesn't have a working directory because it's not meant for development directly on that repository. Instead, it's primarily used for collaboration and sharing changes between developers.

Bare repositories typically have a `.git` extension appended to their directory name to distinguish them from regular repositories. They contain all the version control metadata and the objects necessary for Git operations but lack the working directory structure.

Bare repositories are commonly used in scenarios like:

1. **Centralized Repositories**: A central repository where multiple developers push changes to and pull changes from.
  
2. **Deployment**: Bare repositories are often used for deployment purposes, where the files are pushed to a remote server without the need for a working directory. This is common in CI/CD pipelines and deployment workflows.

To create a bare repository, you can use the `--bare` option with `git init`:
```
git init --bare <repository_name>
```

Or when cloning:
```
git clone --bare <repository_URL>
```

Bare repositories are primarily used in server environments or as central repositories in distributed development workflows.
